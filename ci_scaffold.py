"""CI workflow scaffolding for GitHub Actions.

Generates a `.github/workflows/quality.yml` workflow that runs `make quality`
on pull requests and pushes to main. Supports Python, JavaScript/TypeScript,
and mixed-language repositories.

Part of the HydraFlow prep epic (#561). Language detection is self-contained
to avoid blocking on #562/#563; consolidate when `prep.py` lands.
