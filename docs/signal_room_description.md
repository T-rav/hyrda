# Signal Room

**The conversation layer that keeps your AI workforce connected and coordinated.**

Signal Room is how your agents talk to each other—and how your systems talk to your agents—without anyone getting tangled up in who called whom. Think of it as the office intercom system for your AI operations: when something important happens, the right people get notified instantly, even if they're in different departments or working on different schedules.

## What It Does

When the Lead Qualifier scores a hot prospect, Signal Room tells the Sales Agent to follow up. When a document finishes processing, it alerts the RAG service to index it. When an external webhook fires, it broadcasts that event to any agent that needs to know.

No one has to wait on hold. No one gets missed.

## Why It Matters

**Before Signal Room:** Your CRM updates a lead status, but the Qualifier Agent doesn't know about it until someone manually kicks off a workflow. Data sits stale. Opportunities cool off.

**With Signal Room:** The moment that lead status changes, the Qualifier Agent gets pinged automatically. It runs its analysis, publishes the results, and the Sales Agent—already subscribed to high-score alerts—receives the qualified lead within seconds.

## Key Benefits

- **Nothing falls through the cracks** – Every event gets delivered, even if the recipient is temporarily busy or offline
- **Faster response times** – Agents react to changes as they happen, not on the next polling cycle
- **Easy to add new players** – Want a new agent to listen for qualified leads? Just subscribe it. No rewiring required
- **Clear audit trail** – See exactly what happened, when, and who was notified

## In Plain English

Signal Room is the difference between passing notes in class and using the school PA system. One is slow, unreliable, and easy to miss. The other makes sure the right message reaches the right people at the right time—automatically.
