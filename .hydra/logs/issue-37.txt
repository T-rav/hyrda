Issue #37 is already fully implemented and committed. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Commit `34be7ff`** — "Fixes #37: Move status publish into orchestrator.stop()"

### Changes made:
1. **`orchestrator.py`** — Converted `stop()` from sync to `async def`, added `await self._publish_status()` at the end so the orchestrator publishes its own status change
2. **`dashboard.py`** — Removed the private `_publish_status()` call and added `await` to `request_stop()`, fixing the encapsulation violation
3. **`tests/test_dashboard.py`** — Updated mocks to use `AsyncMock()` for `stop` and `request_stop`, removed the `_publish_status` mock
4. **`tests/test_orchestrator.py`** — Updated tests to be async, added `test_stop_publishes_status` to verify the new behavior
